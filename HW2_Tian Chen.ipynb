      "{'Date': 'August 18, 2023', 'Title': \"The President's News Conference with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan at Camp David, Maryland\", 'President': 'Joseph R. Biden', 'AddressRemark': 'PRESIDENT BIDEN: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Camp David.\\nIf I seem like I\\'m happy, it\\'s because I am. (Laughter.) This has been a great, great meeting.\\nMr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, I -- we meet in this historic place to make a historic moment. And I believe that to be true. The -- this is a new era in partnership between Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States -- our new Camp David trilat. (Laughs.) That\\'s what we have here.\\nAnd -- but before we dive into the progress we\\'ve made today -- if you excuse, we used to say in the Senate, \"a point of personal privilege\" -- I want to start by expressing my appreciation for the contribution that your countries have made toward the relief following the devastating wildfires in Hawaii. I want to thank you both on behalf of the American people.\\nI also want to note that my team is closely monitoring Hurricane Hilary, which is -- has the potential to bring significant rain and flooding to southern California. FEMA has pre-positioned personnel and supplies in the region, and they\\'re ready to respond as needed. I urge everyone -- everyone in the path of this storm to take precautions and listen to the guidance from state and local officials.\\nAnd you\\'ve heard me say it before: The Republic of Korea and Japan are capable and indispensable allies.\\nNow, to the purpose of why we\\'re here.\\nAmerica\\'s commitment to both countries is ironclad, and my personal commitment to bringing these three nations together was real from the very beginning.\\nSince last summer, we\\'ve met on the margins of the NATO Summit in Spain, the ASEAN Summit in Cambodia, and the G7 Summit in Japan. And today, we\\'ve made history with the first-ever standalone summit between the leaders of our three countries, as well as our commitment to meet together on the leader level annually and to have all of our relative Cabinet-member people meet on a regular basis for -- from this point on; not just this year, not next year -- forever. That\\'s the i- -- that\\'s the intention.\\nAnd so, I want to recognize the important work that both of you have done and the political courage -- and I mean this sincerely -- the political courage that you\\'ve both demonstrated to resolve difficult issues that would\\'ve stood in the way for a long time of a close relationship between Japan and Korea and with the United States.\\nYour leadership, with the full support of the United States, has brought us here, because each of you understands that our world stands at an inflection point -- a point where we\\'re called to lead in new ways: to work together, to stand together. And today, I\\'m proud to say our nations are answering that call.\\nFirst, we\\'re elevating our trilateral defense collaboration to deliver in the Indo-Pacific region. That includes launching annual multidomain military exercises, bringing our trilateral defense cooperation to an unprecedented levels.\\nWe\\'re doubling down on information sharing, including on the DPRK\\'s missile launches and cyber activities, strengthening our ballistic missile defense cooperation.\\nAnd, critically -- critically, we\\'ve all committed to swiftly consult with each other in response to threats to any one of our countries from whatever source it occurs. That means we\\'ll have a hotline to share information and coordinate our responses whenever there is a crisis in the region or affecting any one of our countries.\\nAnd today, we\\'ve reaffirmed -- all reaffirmed our shared commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and addressing ec- -- and addressing economic coercion.\\nWe\\'re going to continue to counter threats from the DPRK, including cryptocurrency money laundering to the tune of billions of dollars; potential arms transfer in support of Russia\\'s brutal war against Ukraine.\\nAnd together -- together, we\\'re going to stand up for international law, freedom of navigation, and the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea.\\nSecond, we\\'re expanding our economic cooperation to build an Ino -- an Indo-Pacific that is peaceful and prosperous.\\nToday, we\\'ve committed to launch a new -- what we call a \"Supply Chain Early Warning System\" -- excuse me, a Supply Chain Early Warning System Pilot and -- which will alert our nations to disruptions of certain products and materials, like critical minerals or batteries, so we can get ahead of the issues as we -- they appear with the experience -- that we\\'ve experienced in -- during the pandemic.\\n(Referring to a piece of audio equipment.) Excuse me, this is falling off. There you go.\\nAnd -- and building on the G7-led Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, we\\'re deepening cooperation between our development finance institutions to mobilize more financing for quality infrastructure and secure communications technology to help low-income and middle-income countries throughout the region take on the challenges that matter most to their people.\\nAnd finally, our partnership is about building a better future for our people. That\\'s why we\\'re deepening our cooperation on global health and launching a trilateral expert exchange in support of the U.S. Cancer Moonshot initiative. That\\'s going to, I believe, change cancer as we know it.\\nIt matters a great deal to me and to families all across our three countries. In the United States, we are revolutionizing the way we do cancer research. And together, the three of us, I am confident we can harness our shared spirit of innovation and end cancer as we know it.\\nWe\\'re also launching a new collaboration between our National Laboratories and advance our science knowledge and technological capabilities together. As we do, we\\'ll work in lockstep to set the standards for safe, secure, and trustworthy emerging technology, including artificial intelligence, which a lot of work has to be done on.\\nLet me close with this. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, this is the first summit I\\'ve hosted at Camp David as President. I can think of no more fitting location to begin the next era -- our next era of cooperation -- a place that has long symbolized the power of new beginnings and new possibilities.\\nIn the months and years ahead, we\\'re going to continue to seize those possibilities together -- unwavering in our unity and unmatched in our resolve. This is not about a day, a week, or month. This is about decades and decades of relationships that we\\'re building.\\nMr. Prime Minister and Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leader, and I -- leadership -- and I say it again -- for your courage that brought us together. And I look forward to working with you both of you ahead.\\nNow I yield to -- who am I yielding to?\\nMODERATOR: Distinguished guests --\\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: There you go.\\nMODERATOR: -- the President of the Republic of Korea.\\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: We needed the voice of God to tell us that. (Laughter.)\\nPRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) First of all, I\\'d like to thank President Biden for his warm hospitality. It is a great pleasure to visit Camp David along with Prime Minister Kishida. Camp David is a site that bears historical significance where important diplomatic decisions were made at critical junctures of modern history.\\nIn order to respond to today\\'s unprecedented polycrisis, the ties between our three countries, which are the most advanced liberal democracies in the region and major economies leading advanced technology and scientific innovation, are more important than ever.\\nFrom this moment on, Camp David will be remembered as a historic place where the Republic of Korea, the United States, and Japan proclaimed that we will bolster the rules-based international order and play key roles to enhance regional security and prosperity based on our shared values of freedom, human rights, and rule of law.\\nToday, we, the three leaders, held the very first standalone trilateral summit marking a new chapter in our trilateral cooperation. Today, we have agreed on the Camp David principles that will function as the enduring guidelines for our trilateral cooperation. In addition, we have developed the Spirit of Camp David, which is a document embodying the vision of our trilateral cooperation and ways to translate our will to cooperate into action.\\nFirst of all, to facilitate the stable development of our trilateral cooperation, we have built the institutional basis for the trilateral cooperation at multiple levels and sectors. In addition to making our trilateral summit regular, we have agreed to have our governments\\' personnel at all levels -- including foreign ministers, defense ministers, and national security advisors -- meet every year to closely coordinate our trilateral cooperation.\\nIn particular, we, the three leaders, have agreed to establish a communication channel so we can swiftly coordinate and respond together in case an urgent issue occurs in the region.\\nFurthermore, to bolster our trilateral strategic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, our three countries will establish the ROK, U.S., Japan Indo-Pacific dialogue, which will discover new areas of cooperation. Also, along with the economic security dialogue led by our three countries\\' NSCs, we have agreed to found a consultative body for development policy coordination and also build cooperation frameworks in various sectors including global health and women empowerment.\\nWe have also decided to hold our ROK, U.S., and Japan Global Leadership Youth Summit to strengthen ties between our future generations.\\nSecond, we have agreed to step up our security cooperation to ensure our people\\'s safety and peace in the region based on the now institutionalized Cooperation Framework.\\nFirst of all, to this end, we have consulted on practical ways to cooperate, aimed at improving our joint response capabilities to North Korea\\'s nuclear and missile threats, which have become sophisticated more than ever. The real-time sharing of DPRK missile warning data, which was agreed upon during the Phnom Penh summit last November, will be activated within this year. And this will make a significant progress in strengthening our three nations\\' capabilities to detect and track North Korea\\'s missiles.\\nIn countering the DPRK\\'s nuclear and missile threats, we concurred the trilateral defense exercises were crucial. As such, annual plans will be established for the ROK, U.S., Japan drills we committed to.\\nIn the meantime, as North Korea funds its nuclear and missile programs by exploiting labor and human rights, efforts to monitor and stem such activities will be redoubled. To deter the DPRK\\'s illicit funding activities, a new trilateral working group on DPRK cyber activities will be established.\\nMoreover, Korea, the U.S., and Japan, in their pursuit of Indo-Pacific strategies, oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force.\\nRespect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, the peaceful settlement of disputes, among others, undergird a rules-based international order that we resolve to safeguard by intensifying our collaboration.\\nAs part of such endeavors, our three nations agreed to support ASEAN and Pacific Island countries with their maritime security capacity-building efforts.\\nFurthermore, to help Ukrainians regain freedom and pursue reconstruction, we are determined to increase our three-way coordination.\\nNext, we, the three leaders, discussed how to work together to promote shared prosperity and future growth. First of all, in the field of economic security directly linked to our national economies of the three countries, we will work to expand our strategic partnership.\\nTo ensure global supply chain resilience and energy security, we pledged to bolster our trilateral cooperation. To manage global supply chain risks, an early warning system will be established together.\\nIn addition, we decided to broaden our collaboration in the field of cutting-edge technologies to secure future growth engines. Specifically, in AI, quantum, bio, and next-generation telecommunications and space sectors, cooperation among our three countries will deliver powerful synergies.\\nKorea, the U.S., and Japan committed to have their national laboratories expand joint R&D and personnel exchanges, providing a cornerstone for the three countries\\' leadership in science and technology innovation.\\nMoreover, for the sake of shared prosperity in the Asia Pacific, in line with the needs of ASEAN and Pacific Island countries, effective support measures will be sought and implemented collectively.\\nToday, we, the three leaders, affirmed our commitment to the trilateral partnership towards a new era and possibilities thereof.\\nGrounded in the core values of freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, a strong alliance of values among Korea, the U.S., and Japan will help build a world that\\'s more peaceful and prosperous by serving as a sturdy foundation.\\nMr. President, I thank you once again for your hospitality. Next time, I hope that we will be reunited in the Republic of Korea.\\nThank you. (Applause.)\\nMODERATOR: Distinguished guests, the Prime Minister of Japan.\\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: President.\\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you. First of all, in Maui, Hawaii, wildfires caused devastating damage. I express my sympathy, and I really pray for the peace of those who have lost their lives.\\nIn order to offer support, a total of $2 million worth of support by our country has been decided. And the full -- the relief for the affected people and for the earliest recovery of the affected areas, Japan will proactively do our contribution.\\nToday, I have visited Camp David, and the three of us have spent a truly meaningful time. I expressed my heartfelt gratitude to Joe for the kind invitation.\\nTogether with Joe and President Yoon, this has been a precious opportunity for myself to further deepen the relationship of trust and confidence. For the first time ever, instead of in the sidelines of multilateral conferences, we have held the trilateral summit on a standalone basis.\\nHere at Camp David, numerous historical meetings have taken place. And it is a huge honor to have printed a fresh page in its history with this meeting.\\nThe foundation of the trilateral collaboration are the solid, firm, bilateral relationships. The three of us have understood this more than anyone else and have executed our understanding in practice.\\nIn January of this year, I visited the United States, and later, President Yoon visited Japan in March and then to the U.S. in April. And in May, I myself traveled to South Korea, and we have bolstered our mutual relationship.\\nAt the moment, the free and open international order, based on the rule of law, is in crisis. Due to Russia\\'s aggression of Ukraine, the international order is shaken from its foundation. The unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas are continuing. And the nuclear and missile threat of North Korea is only becoming ever larger.\\nUnder such circumstances, to make our trilateral strategic collaboration blossom and bloom is only logical and almost inevitable and is required in this era.\\nThe three of us here today declare our determination to pioneer the new era of Japan, U.S., ROK partnership.\\nHow we will advance the cooperation of our three countries going forward, I will discuss from three perspectives.\\nFirstly, the coordination between the Japan-U.S. and the U.S.-ROK alliances will be reinforced, and trilateral security cooperation will be brought to a new height.\\nAt this meeting, we agreed to hold the Japan-U.S.-ROK multidomain joint exercises on an annual basis. Furthermore, regarding the real-time sharing of North Korea\\'s missile warning information that we agreed last November, the initial steps have been implemented and an important first step has been advanced towards the launch of the mechanism by the end of the year.\\nWe also agreed on the establishment of the working group on North Korea cyber activities, considered to be the source of finance for nuclear and missile development and on other matters.\\nThe second point is the promotion of cooperation between the United States, Japan, and South Korea and the expansion of their areas of cooperation regarding the response to North Korea.\\nIn addition to strengthening regional deterrence and response capabilities, the three countries agreed to strengthen cooperation for the full implementation of sanctions and to work closely together in the U.N. Security Council, where all three countries will be members in 2024.\\nAt the same time, we shared our recognition that the way is open for dialogue with North Korea. I then stated that the abduction issue is a humanitarian issue with time constraints and once again received the strong support of Joe and President Yoon for the immediate resolution of this matter.\\nWe also agreed to work together through the Indo-Pacific dialogue and the development cooperation to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific and, in particular, to coordinate capacity-building support in the domain of maritime security, particularly with regard to ASEAN and Pacific Island countries.\\nFurthermore, we agreed to promote cooperation in the field of economic security, including critical and emerging technologies and supply chain resilience.\\nThird, developing a framework for trilateral cooperation. This will create a foundation for continuous and stable enhancement of coordination among the three countries.\\nAfter confirming that the three countries will promote multi-layered cooperation at all levels, it was agreed that the trilateral summit meeting will be held at least once a year.\\nAnd likewise, the ministers of foreign affairs, defense, and national security advisors will each also meet at least once a year. And the financial minister, as well as the industry and commerce ministers, will be meeting.\\nWe will consider the Camp David principles issued today at a historic turning point for the international community to be a new compass for trilateral cooperation, and we will vigorously implement the concrete cooperation outlined in the Camp David statement of Japan, ROK, and U.S. on our partnership.\\nTogether with Joe and President Yoon, we will continue to work to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the three countries in order to safeguard a free and open international order based on the rule of law.\\nThank you. (Applause.)\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you. Now we have time for questions. President Biden, please select your reporter first.\\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Aamer, with the AP.\\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for each of the leaders. They will be brief and -- but related.\\nPresident Biden, first for you: How confident should Asia be about a robust American commitment to a nuclear umbrella when the Compa- -- Commander-in-Chief who preceded you and is looking to succeed you spoke openly about reducing the U.S. footprint in the Korean Peninsula?\\nPresident Yoon, how much confidence can Japan and the U.S. have about Seoul\\'s long-term commitment to rapprochement when polls show the solid majority of Korea disapproves of your handling and mending of the forced labor issue?\\nAnd, Prime Minister Kishida, what assurances can you give to your country\\'s citizens who fear bolstering your security cooperation in this matter could lead to -- the country into an economic cold war with China?\\nAnd if you\\'ll indulge me, Mr. President, on a domestic matter: What is your reaction to the Special Counsel appointment last week into your son?\\nThank you.\\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: (Laughs.) Well, first of all, look, there\\'s not much, if anything, I agree on with my predecessor on foreign policy. His America First policy, walking away from the rest of the world, has made us weaker, not stronger.\\nAmerica is strong with our allies and our alliances, and that\\'s why we will endure. And it\\'s a strength that -- quite frankly, that increases all the -- three of our strengths.\\nThis is just about one summit. What makes today different is it actually launches a series of initiatives that are actually institutional changes in how we deal with one another -- in security cooperation, economic cooperation, technology cooperation, development cooperation, consultation exercises. And all of this will create (inaudible) momentum, I believe, year by year, month by month, to make the relationship stronger and more certain to remain to be in place.\\nAnd with regard -- on these esult- -- results, I think you\\'re going to keep it going. And I think you\\'re going to benefit all our countries.\\nAnd with regard to the second question, I make -- I have no comment on any investigation that\\'s going on. That\\'s up to the Justice Department, and that\\'s all I have to say.\\nPRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) To the question that was directed to me, I would like to say that the treaty made between Korea and Japan that was made in 1965 and the following measures by the government and the Supreme Court\\'s ruling in 2015 have some differences. But we have already implemented measures to bridge the gaps among them.\\nAnd in South Korea, of course, there is public opinion that is opposed to the government\\'s measures like that. However, from a perspective that\\'s forward-looking, strengthening ties and improving relationships between Korea and Japan are important and there is a shared understanding that this matters to our bilateral relationship, as well as our future. And this is something we need to continue working on.\\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you for the question. First of all, at today\\'s meeting, the rules-based international order and activities inconsistent to such rule-based international order and activities. Other concerns have been shared, and the rule-based, free and open international order must be defended. And going forward, the U.S., Japan, ROK strategic collaboration will be reinforced even further. Such endeavors will continue going forward.\\nOur country and for the surrounding countries, the response capabilities, as well as defense capabilities, will be bolstered. And by doing so, the lives and livelihood of our population will be protected and the sense of assurance must be raised. These are the important activities.\\nHaving said that, with regard to China, last year, in November, there was the Japan-China Leaders Summit, and there was a positive momentum. By maintaining the positive momentum, what has to be asserted will be asserted. And we shall strongly request responsible conduct. And we will continue an accumulative conversation about multiple issues. We will cooperate with regard to common challenges. Such constructive and stable relationship will be established by mutual effort.\\nThat is my administration\\'s consistent policy. Based on this perception towards regional stability, our efforts will continue.\\nThank you.\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: President Yoon, next question, please.\\nPRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) Please go ahead and ask a question. The reporter from Money Today -- reporter named Jongjin Park. Please go ahead with your question.\\nQ: (As interpreted.) Hi, I\\'m Jongjin Park of Money Today. First of all, I would like to ask a question to President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. I heard that you said that a new chapter has opened in our trilateral cooperation with the two countries. Compared to the previous summits, what would be the most significant outcome that you gained through this summit?\\nAnd also, from the perspective of our people, what would be the benefit that the people of Korea would feel from these strengthening of ties?\\nAnd now my question goes to President Biden. During this summit, the issues of detainees or prisoners of wars -- and you mentioned that there will be further cooperation in these human rights issues. And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?\\nLastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today, we had a historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That\\'s the international community\\'s evaluation.\\nHowever, there are still concerns that Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain. And also, how would you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our bilateral relations going forward?\\nPRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) First of all, this trilateral cooperation amongst our three countries has opened a new chapter, and we made that announcement today to talk about the differences from the past cooperation.\\nFor instance, in the past, it was about individual issues that we sought cooperation among ourselves. But now, as we have opened a new chapter in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women -- across all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work together. So it\\'s much more comprehensive in nature.\\nSuch comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the DPRK. And across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world.\\nSo that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That\\'s where we find our shared interests lie.\\nAnd at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science.\\nOur three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies.\\nNaturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits -- tangible benefits to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology.\\nBut what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that\\'s exactly where our interests are aligned.\\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: I -- look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they\\'re feeling. It\\'s real.\\nWe know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. We\\'re not going to forget about them or their loved ones.\\nAnd there\\'s clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: that we share a common position. We\\'re committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and -- and those who\\'ve been abducted and detained.\\nAnd by the way, one of the things we get asked many times -- and it wasn\\'t directly asked, but implied -- is what makes us think any of this is positive.\\nSuccess brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?\\nThink about -- as students of history, all of you -- and you are -- think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don\\'t anticipate it.\\nAnd so, I -- I just think this is a -- we\\'re not going to forget, we\\'re not giving up, and we\\'re going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees.\\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) With regard to your question for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening bilateral relationships between the ROK and Japan. I share that with President Yoon. The two countries, in dealing with international challenges, should cooperate. We\\'re both important neighboring countries. And so, friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new era. And that is my thinking.\\nThis year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the ROK. At international fora, we have repeated meetings -- we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we\\'ve had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It\\'s already in motion, dynamically.\\nEconomic security dialogue was started -- or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also financial ministers and defense ministers have had meetings.\\nAnd so, we\\'ve had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We\\'re seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.\\nGoing forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further. By generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan\\'s feelings towards our bilateral relations. And we\\'d like to continue such efforts.\\nThank you.\\nThank you very much. Then, let me see. From Kyodo -- Tajiri-san, Kyodo News.\\nQ: (As interpreted.) Tajiri, Kyodo News. At Camp David with history. I do have a question to each of the leaders.\\nPresident Biden, it was mentioned at this summit meeting that Russia\\'s aggression of Ukraine is continuing. So, what role do you expect of Japan?\\nPrime Minister Kishida has mentioned that as China\\'s threat in Asia is rising, Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow. What do you think about this comment, President Biden?\\nAnd the situation in Asia, where China\\'s threat is rising -- what is the meaning and significance of the trilateral relationship with Japan, U.S., ROK becoming stronger in multiple layers?\\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol, I have a question to Your Excellency. North Korea\\'s nuclear missile development is a major security threat to Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. As North Korea\\'s provocations continue to escalate, what is the meaning and significance of the three countries declaring a new era of partnership?\\nRegarding the release of treated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, did Prime Minister Kishida explain the matter at the trilateral or the bilateral summit today?\\nTo the recent Japan-ROK summit meeting, Your Excellency, you expressed your intent to respect the IAEA report despite the strong domestic opposition. Why do you demonstrate your understanding for the policy of Kishida administration? I ask for that reason.\\nAnd to Prime Minister Kishida, this is the first time that a trilateral summit is held on a standalone basis rather than on the sidelines of international meetings. You have said that the trilateral cooperation will be raised to new heights for the security environment in East Asia. And without the resolution of abduction, North Korea is continuing nuclear missile development. What is the meaning for North Korea?\\nAnd in eastern South China Seas, by maritime advancement, China is continuing unilateral attempts to change the status quo. What is the meaning for China?\\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: And you have a great imagination. One question ends up being six. But, thank you. I\\'ll try to answer all of it. (Laughter.) I\\'m glad I didn\\'t have you as my law professor when he said \"one question.\" (Laughs.) At any rate, they\\'re all legitimate questions.\\nLook, on Ukraine, I and my country and the leadership of my country in both parties are very grateful for everything Japan is helping to deal with in Ukraine. And I mean that sincerely. You\\'ve showed strong leadership through the G7 as well and contributed to a significant amount of financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as nonlethal military equipment.\\nAnd, you know -- and they joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable through their international sanctions.\\nIf my memory serves me well -- and I think it does, Mr. Prime Minister -- we found ourselves in a circumstance where, when I called you about Ukraine, I didn\\'t have to convince you of anything. I started off to make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where -- to think, in the first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over 150,000 forces on the border of another country -- or 150,000 forces and invade that country -- invade that country without any rationale other than -- if you read Putin\\'s speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv being the motherland. You know, I mean, it just was ridiculous, I think. And he talked about being Peter the Great. It was --\\nJust imagine if we had done nothing. Imagine if we had done nothing.\\nAnd the point was immediately recognized, if I\\'m not mistaken, by you, Mr. Prime Minister, that we\\'re\\nin a situation where it could happen anywhere. If we stand -- if we had stood still, what signal would that send to China about Taiwan? What signal would that send around the world if nations weren\\'t powerful on borders?\\nBut here\\'s the deal. You contributed significantly to what, I think, is already the --\\nLet me put it this way. Russia has already lost. It cannot meet its original objective which it stated. It\\'s not possible.\\nBut -- and they\\'ve joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable for international sanctions. But Japan\\'s leadership, from day one, it has been critical for making it clear that the consequences for war extend well beyond Europe -- well beyond Europe.\\nI say it in reverse. What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000 troops invaded another? You think that would not affect the interests, the economy, and -- and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin America all across the world? It would have profound impact.\\nAnd with Japan\\'s leadership, from day one, it has been critical to making clear the consequences of this will extend well beyond Europe -- well beyond Europe. It\\'s a global issue that has impacts everywhere. And the Prime Minister\\'s comments at Shangri La capture that.\\nAnd by the way, you know, we talked about this being an inflection point. The world is changing. The world is changing. And about every six or seven generations, it makes significant change. And there\\'s a lot happening.\\nAnd the idea that we\\'re going to sit down, the rest of the world, and say, \"Well, that\\'s only a European problem.\" There hasn\\'t been that kind of invasion since World War Two.\\nAnd so -- as for peace, we all want that, of course. Ukrainians want it most of all. And my team has been working very closely with the -- President Zelenskyy\\'s team and further peace formula, noting that \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"\\nBut nonetheless, we\\'re meeting with them constantly -- constantly.\\nAnd your other two questions about China -- I\\'ll just say this: This summit was not about China. That was not the purpose of the meeting. But it did come -- China obviously came up. Not to say we don\\'t share concerns about the economic coercion or heightened tensions caused by China, but this summit was really about our relationship with each other and deepening cooperation across an entire range of issues that went well beyond just the immediate issues we raised.\\nIt was about more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific -- a region, quite frankly, that would benefit everyone living there and around the world if we get it right. It\\'s not just here. It has a phenomenal impact.\\nThink about what\\'s -- at any rate, I won\\'t get going. I\\'ll take too long.\\nBut as you\\'ve seen from the initiatives we\\'re announcing here, today is just how committed we are to see this vision take place. And I think this relationship that we put together and I think we\\'re going to -- you\\'re going to see it expand. It\\'s not merely what we did today. This is a historic meeting.\\nBut we\\'re about to -- we\\'ve laid in place a long-term structure for a relationship that will last and have a phenomenal impact not just in Asia, but around the world.\\nSomeone once said in a different context that -- about a health- -- a healthcare provision in my country a while ago: This is a big deal. This is a big deal.\\nThank you.\\nQ: President Biden, how soon do you anticipate meeting with President Xi --\\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: They have to answer their questions.\\nPRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) Yes, let me address the questions directed to me.\\nFirst, as to North Korea\\'s nuclear and missile provocations and the threats that are posed and how we plan to counter those threats together among our three countries, let me address that question.\\nOf the cooperative frameworks among our three countries is the most -- what is most symbolic out of those is our cooperation in defense area. Any provocations or attacks against any one of our three countries will trigger a decision-making process of this trilateral framework, and our solidarity will become even stronger and harder.\\nAnd at the same time, missile information will be shared in a real-time basis, and systematic training and drills will be implemented in accordance with systematic annual schedules, regular schedules, and regular trainings that we plan to carry out together against the DPRK\\'s missile provocations. That will be our response.\\nAnd at the same time, regarding your question concerning the water release from the Fukushima plant, as a matter of fact, that issue was not addressed during our summit because it was not on the agenda.\\nBut still, let me try to address that question. The Fukushima plant\\'s treated water, if it\\'s going to have some type of impact, it would flow through the entire Pacific Ocean having an impact not just on our three countries, but all countries around the world.\\nAs such, for the sake of safety and health of the people of our three countries and all members of the international community, that should be something that we need to place the highest priority on.\\nRegarding this treated water, based on scientific principles, all of the processing should be carried out accordingly. And at the same time, internationally recognized and reliable IAEA\\'s investigation results are something that we can trust.\\nAnd I would like to make sure that everything is conducted and carried out in accordance with the procedures established by the IAEA. Together with the international community and also together with the Koreans, transparent data disclosure would be necessary, in my opinion.\\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) Thank you. The question to myself. As you mentioned, nuclear and missile development by North Korea or unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas are ongoing. And the security environment surrounding our three countries, it has becoming increasingly harsh day after day.\\nUnder this backdrop, on this occasion, we agreed to enhance the coordination between the U.S.-Japan and the U.S.-ROK alliances and to bring the trilateral security cooperation to new heights.\\nThis is indeed the requirement of this era. And by this summit, I am sure that the trilateral security cooperation will further advance and reinforce the regional peace and stability.\\nIn particular, with regard to North Korea, we were able to put forward concrete results, such as the implementation of annual Japan, U.S, ROK multidomain and joint exercises and the establishment of a working group to address North Korea\\'s cyber activities.\\nI also stated that the abduction issue is a humanitarian issue with time constraints. And Joe and President Yoon reiterated their strong support for the immediate resolution of this matter.\\nWe also shared our recognition that the path to dialogue with North Korea is open.\\nFurthermore, once again, the presidents of both countries aligned with me in strongly opposing unilateral changes to the status quo through the use of force.\\nWe will continue our efforts to further strengthen the strategic partnership among the three countries in order to defend the free, open, and international order based on the rule of law.\\nThat is all. Thank you.\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: This concludes --\\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: To answer your question, I expect and hope to follow up on our conversation on Bali this fall. That\\'s my expectation. Thank you.\\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: This concludes our press conference. Please -- please stay seated as the -- the leaders depart, please. Please stay seated.\\nQ: Mr. President, are you winning the competition with China?\\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: We\\'re winning all the competition.', 'Link': 'https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu//documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-yoon-suk-yeol-the-republic-korea-and-prime', 'Citation': \"Joseph R.

Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. President, it's an honor to welcome you both here today to inaugurate the Camp David trilateral between our three nations -- among our three nations.\\nIt's not only the first summit I've hosted at Camp David, it's the first-ever standalone summit between the leaders of Japan and Republic of Korea and the United States.\\nAnd I can think of no better way -- no better way to mark our new chapter of our trilateral cooperation than meeting here at Camp David.\\nAnd so, strengthening the ties between our democracies has long been a priority for me, dating back to when I was vice president of the United States. That's because our countries are stronger and the world is safer -- let me say that again --our countries are stronger and the world will be safer as we stand together. And I know this is a belief we all three share.\\nAnd I want to thank you both for your political courage that brought you here. And I'm looking forward to us having a great meeting, but continuing these meetings.\\nYou've stepped up to do the hard work -- the, I would argue, historic work -- to forge a foundation from which we can face the future together -- the three of us together.\\nAnd I'm deeply grateful for your leadership, and I look forward to working with both of you as we begin this new era of cooperation and renew our resolve to serve as a force of good across the Indo-Pacific and, quite frankly, around the world as well.\\nPresident Yoon, let me turn this over to you.\\nPRESIDENT YOON: (As interpreted.) I would like to extend my gratitude to President Biden for his warm hospitality. Last July, we met in Vilnius for the NATO Summit, and I'm pleased to be reunited in about a month.\\nAt this symbolic venue of Camp David in the history of modern diplomacy, our trilateral partnership is opening a new chapter, which carries great significance, in my view.\\nPresident Roosevelt once stated: Freedom is not a given but something you fight to win. To make sure that each of our freedoms is neither threatened or damaged, our three nations must tighten our solidarity. Such is also our promise and mandate towards our future generations.\\nThe stronger coordination between Korea, the U.S., and Japan requires more robust institutional foundations. Moreover, challenges that threaten regional security must be addressed by us building a stronger commitment to working together.\\nToday will be remembered as a historic day where we established a firm institutional basis and commitments to the trilateral partnership.\\nToday, I hope we will explore together ways to elevate cooperation between Korea, the U.S., and Japan to a new plane through in-depth discussions.\\nPRIME MINISTER KISHIDA: (As interpreted.) First of all, I would like to express my sympathy once again for the devastating damages caused by the wildfires in Maui, Hawaii. In order to provide relief to the affected people, Japan has decided to offer a total of around $2 million of support. I offer my heartfelt prayer for the earliest possible recovery of the affected areas.\\nMay I also once again convey my heartfelt condolences for the passing away of President Yoon's father.\\nAnd now I would like to thank Joe for your kind invitation to the two of us to Camp David, a place with history.\\nPresident Yoon, I have been meeting you almost on a monthly basis since March of this year. But the fact that we -- the three leaders have got together in this way, I believe, means that we are indeed making a new history as of today.\\nThe international community is at a turning point in history. In order to allow the potential of our trilateral strategic collaboration to bloom and to blossom, I wish to take this moment to raise the security -- the coordination between Japan, ROK, and the U.S. to new heights while strengthening the coordination between the Japan-U.S. and the U.S.-ROK alliances as we deepen our cooperation in the response to North Korea.\\nI wish to expand and deepen our collaboration in extensive areas, including economic security, such as critical and emergent technology, cooperation, and supply chains resilience.\\nToday, I look forward to engaging in frank discussions amongst ourselves in order to declare a new area of Japan, U.S., ROK partnership.\\nI once again express my gratitude for Joe's initiative.

But she loved with a fierceness and a tenderness that was incredible. And it was the Irish of her. She just was incredible.\\nAnd I was saying earlier that -- my sister and I were talking about her. And my sister reminded me of a quote about Michelangelo. It said: He saw the angel in the marble and carved until he set it free. That's what she did with everybody. I mean, she really did, if you're knew her.\\nI know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I've been coming back home since -- I've never left, actually. And I've known the Caseys for the bulk of my life. I don't remember when I didn't know the Ca- -- the Caseys.\\nAnd Bobby's dad was older than me, then I am older than Bobby. And we lived not far from one another. He was on Wyoming Avenue, and I lived on North Washington Avenue. We went to the same parish, St. Paul's.\\nAnd anyway, just a -- she's an incredible woman. And she raised an enormously successful and decent family. All the values I learned, I learned them here in Scranton. And she was an embodiment of them.\\nSo, I -- the reason I am not going to the funeral tomorrow is everyone would have to be wanded to go in -- that I'd -- I'd mess everything up if I went.\\nBut in addition to that, I have to meet with -- at Camp David with two world leaders tomorrow morning.\\nBut in addition, I didn't come -- I'm not going to stay at the viewing when the people are coming in. But, again, they have to be wanded; I just become an impediment.\\nI just want to show my respect to the family. So --\\nQ: Can you tell us about your Hawaii trip, sir?\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, not now.

      "{'Date': 'August 16, 2023', 'Title': 'Remarks on the Anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act', 'President': 'Joseph R. Biden', 'AddressRemark': 'THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Scott. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Please, thank you.\\nI think your patience today exceeds your good judgment, but thank you. (Laughter.)\\nAnd I want to say one thing to your children: I know some really great ice cream places around here -- (laughter) -- and Daddy owes you. Okay? (Laughter.) So, talk to me afterwards.\\nFolks, thanks for the introduction. And, Scott, thank you very much.\\nYou know, I want to thank Vice President Harris; members of the Cabinet -- Secretary Vilsack, Administrator Regan; you know, members of Congress, and particularly Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who played such a pivotal role in getting this bill done.\\nEveryone was telling us there is no possibility with the divided Congress -- the way it was -- that we could get it done. And you got it done without a single vote on the other team, although that began to change at the end.\\nAnd all the special guests, state and local leaders, business leaders, entrepreneurs, advocates.\\nYou know, one year ago, with your leadership, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law and -- one of the most significant laws I think has ever been enacted -- taking on the special interests and winning -- and winning. (Applause.)\\nDelivering -- delivering on promises that have long been made to the American people to lower costs for families, especially healthcare costs, increase America\\'s energy security, restore fairness to a tax code, create good-paying jobs here in America, and to address the existential threat of climate crisis.\\nYou know, it\\'s part of a much broader vision for our country: growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.\\nI\\'m a capitalist. I think if you can go make a billion dollars, go make it. I\\'m all for that. Just pay your taxes. (Laughter.)\\nBut because when the middle class does well -- all kidding aside -- everybody does well. Everybody. The poor have a ladder up. The middle class are -- have a good shot. And -- and -- and the wealthy do very well.\\nThe Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal initially called my plan \"Bidenomics.\" I\\'m not sure they meant it in a totally complimentary way at the time. (Laughter.) But guess what? It\\'s working. (Applause.)\\nOur economic plan -- made possible by all of you in this room, and that\\'s not hyperbole -- created more than 13 million 400 thousand jobs -- new jobs since I took office. Nearly 800 -- (applause) -- nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs.\\nWhere is it written that America can\\'t create the most vibrant and innovative economy and be the world\\'s leading manufacturer again? Where is that written? I didn\\'t see that anywhere.\\nWe\\'ve created more jobs in two years than any administration has in a single four-year term. And I\\'m very proud -- (applause) -- and I\\'m very proud that unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in over 50 years. (Applause.) Below 4 percent and going down.\\nWe now have more jobs than we did before the pandemic. And workers aren\\'t just finding more jobs, they\\'re finding better jobs, higher pay, higher job satisfaction. And unemployment is down and so is inflation.\\nRemember what the experts told us, okay? And they\\'re traditional economists, very smart women and men. They told us getting inflation under control, in order to do it, we had to lower wages and increase unemployment. Not a joke. Had to lower wages and increase unemployment.\\nBut we never, never, never thought the problem was too many people -- I -- at least, I didn\\'t -- too many people that were working or that working people were making too much money. I just thought that was not the best answer to how to get it down.\\nNow, one reason we\\'ve seen inflation fall by two thirds without losing jobs is corporate profits are coming back down to earth. The excesses are being eliminated by the corporations.\\nWe have more to do, but inflation is now at the lowest point it\\'s been in two years.\\nWhen the Inflation Reduction Act was passed a year ago today, inflation was -- as pointed out by Chuck or Nancy; I can\\'t remember which one -- 8.3 percent. It\\'s now down to 3.2 percent -- (applause) -- the lowest amount -- and it\\'s going to go lower.\\nBut here\\'s the point: It\\'s lowest among the world\\'s leading economies. Take every major economy in the world. We have the lowest uninflat- -- inflation rate.\\nAt the same time, wages are growing faster than inflation, and this matters.\\nThe way I think about inflation is the way my dad used to talk about it around the kitchen table. Not a joke. I\\'m being deadly earnest about this. He\\'d ask, \"How much is left after all the monthly bills are paid? How much do you have left over after you pay them all? And is there -- at the end of the month, just to have a little bit of breathing room. Just a little bit of breathing room.\"\\nThat\\'s one of the reasons why we\\'ve worked so hard dealing with Pharma and other things. Not only do you get the overall cost of average people and the monthly bills down, in addition to inflation, the Inflation Reduction Act is giving people more breathing room, as my dad would say. And it\\'s supercharging the economic transition in key ways.\\nFirst, it\\'s taking the most aggressive action ever on climate energy -- ever. I\\'ve long said -- and I\\'ve -- that\\'s why I think all the unions have come along. I\\'ve long said: When I think climate -- not a joke -- I think jobs. I think jobs. (Applause.) For real.\\nAnd, by the way, none of this would have happened had the unions not stepped up and supported us. The idea -- (applause) -- they wouldn\\'t have. It would not have happened.\\nThis law is one of the biggest drivers of jobs and economic growth this country has ever seen.\\nSince I took office, the private sector has announced nearly 400 -- excuse me -- $240 billion in new clean energy manufacturing investments. That\\'s private sector -- $240 billion investment. (Applause.)\\nAnd the law has already created an estimated 170,000 clean energy jobs in one year. It\\'s estimated that it will -- it will -- that will grow to 1.5 million more jobs over the next decade. First, it was one year. Now we\\'re talking about the decade.\\nYou know, just don\\'t take it from me. The CEO of U.S. Steel called the Inflation Reduction Act \"Manufacturing…\" -- he called it the \"Manufacturing Renaissance Act\" because it\\'s bringing jobs back to America, manufacturing here in America. Made in America.\\nAccording to leading Wall Street firms Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, my broader investment -- our broader investment in Investing in America agenda is unleashing a boom -- a boom of manufacturing investments.\\nAnd we\\'re leaving nobody behind. We\\'re investing in all of America: in the Heartland and coast to coast.\\nYou know, I saw some of our -- a few of my Democratic friends -- not in Congress -- but friends said, \"Look, you\\'re -- you\\'re investing more in red states than in blue states.\" Well, I made a commitment. This is about all of America. I was the Pre- -- (applause) -- no, I really mean it.\\nAnd we\\'ve seen progress across the country, from Maine to South Carolina, to Minnesota, to New Mexico. The Vice President and I and the Cabinet have seen progress across the country.\\nJust yesterday, I was in Wisconsin at a -- at a company that makes clean energy equipment, including wind turbines. Because of the Inflation Reduction Act, they expect their market in American-made wind turbine generators to double next year.\\nAnd, by the way, the guy who was the most ardent opponent of all this was talking about what great benefits are coming to Wisconsin. (Laughter.)\\nBless me, Father. I have -- (laughter). I\\'m going to be a good boy. (Laughter.) I\\'m going to keep the Irish in me down a little bit here. (Laughter.)\\nAt the same time, we\\'re also boosting our nation\\'s energy security. For years, China dominated the clean energy supply chains. We became -- we let the American jobs and factories go overseas. For how long have we gone through this period where the answer for the previous -- mostly in Republican, but some Democratic administrations -- the answer had been: Find the cheapest labor in the world; go -- close the factory here, build it over there, wherever that is; and then import the product from abroad?\\nNot anymore. We are building it here and sending the product over there. (Applause.) No, I mean it.\\nWe\\'re bringing -- we\\'re bringing critical supply chains and technologies home for electric vehicle batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, critical minerals.\\nAnd because of the CHIPS and Science Act, we\\'ve generated $231 billion in private investment, in making semiconductors -- $231 billion. A small -- that small computer chip, the size of the end of your -- your fingertip that affects nearly everything in our lives, from cellphones, to automobiles, to the most sophisticated weapons systems.\\nYou know, we invented these chips. We used to produce these chips. We stopped. And we saw it during the pandemic -- we paid a high price for things that went overseas. Factories shut down; we paid a big price. But now we\\'re bringing semiconductors home.\\nIn 2030, the Inflation Reduction Act is projected to help triple wind power and increase solar power by eightfold. By 2030, electric -- electrically deployed -- excuse me, electricity deployed through the U.S. power grid is expected to be powered by 81 percent clean energy. Do you hear me? Eighty-one percent clean energy. (Applause.)\\nImagine the impact on climate and the air we breathe. The law is going to help meet all of my bold climate goals by cutting carbon pollution in half by 2030 -- in half by 2030. (Applause.)\\nAnd between the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we\\'re investing more than $50 billion to build up resilience in impacts on climate change.\\nThese laws support important priorities, from addressing historic drought along the Colorado River Basin. Remember when I said we had a concern about the Colorado River literally going dry? You all thought I was crazy. I wish I had been. But guess what? I was just out there and looking down on the Grand Canyon. And guess what? It\\'s coming back.\\nBut any rate, we\\'re responding to coastal erosion, sea level rise in the Gulf of Mexico, and helping reduce the effects of extreme heat by investing nearly $1.5 billion to plant trees and expand community parks and forests.\\nFolks, there\\'s a lot more, and you\\'ve heard a lot today, and I\\'m going to not go into it all. But this law is helping mem- -- families save thousands of dollars on energy bills every year through the tax credit and rebates to buy new and efficient electric appliances, weatherize their homes, install heat pumps, rooftop solar.\\nAs a consequence of this, it\\'s estimated that the consumer is going to save at least $27 billion in electric bills between now and 2030. (Applause.)\\nWe\\'re also offering tax credits up to $7,500 to buy new electric vehicles -- and I\\'ve worked it out with the European Union -- (laughter) -- and fuel cells made here in America.\\nFor the first time, we can get a tax credit to buy used electric vehicles. And thanks to the law, new electric vehicles are going to save -- this is -- this is a fact, if we do this -- and we\\'re doing it now -- tens of billions of gallons of gasoline between now and 2030. That\\'s a lot less pollution. (Applause.)\\nAnd I\\'m not even going to start to talk to you about Amtrak. (Laughter.) It\\'s going to save billions of dollars -- and I really mean it -- in energy costs. But we\\'ll get into that later. (Laughter.)\\nLet me be clear on this point: When I say climate means jobs, I mean good-paying union jobs. (Applause.)\\nAnd the law -- and the law will give an added boost to clean energy products that pay a prevailing wage, employ registered apprenticeships, and use made-in-America parts and products, and not violate any international trade agreements. It\\'s all in the law.\\nAnd we\\'re rein- -- we\\'re reincentivizing companies to build clean energy projects in the same communities that powered our nation with fossil fuels. We owe them -- whether it was Scranton, Pennsylvania, or West Virginia or wherever it has been. The fos- -- they\\'ve -- they\\'ve supplied the fossil fuels we needed for generations.\\nFor example, next generation batteries are being made in an old steel mill in West Virginia. Solar panels are going to be -- to go -- going to a closed coal plant in New Mexico.\\nThese incentives are going to help make clean energy jobs good-paying union jobs and ensure the benefits of clean energy economy reaching communities left behind. And they\\'re left behind -- when they left behind, they lost their pride. They lost a sense of who they were. They lost what was going on. To reach communities too often left behind -- and that\\'s the focus.\\nAnd we\\'re already seeing it happen. Laborers and carpenters are building solar farms. Iron workers and operating engineers building wind projects. Electricians installing solar panels and electric vehicle chargers. By the way, 500,000 of those suckers. And it\\'s going to mean a lot. And it\\'s a big deal.\\nThe clean energy economy should also be a win-win for auto companies and union workers. You know, as the Big Three automakers and companies -- the United Auto Workers negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement, I\\'m asking him to work together to forge a fair agreement.\\nTogether -- together, we can make this transition to a clean energy future fair and just. And that means ensuring that auto jobs continue to be good jobs that can su- -- you can support a family on. (Applause.)\\nBut auto companies honor the right of workers to organize, taking every possible step to avoid painful plant closings. And that when transitions are needed, they are fair and designed to retool, reboot, and rehire the same -- in the same factory and communities at a competitive wage while the existing workers get the first shot to fill those jobs. That\\'s only fair. It matters.\\nSecond, because the Inflation Reduction Act, we\\'re -- we\\'re -- we\\'re talking about lifesaving steps to reduce healthcare costs. It locks in place the lower healthcare premiums for millions of American families under the Affordable Care Act, saving them an average of $800 a year.\\nAnd I see my friends in the Congress who saw that -- in the Senate and House who saw that -- make that happen.\\nPlus, we pay more for our prescription drugs than any country -- major country in the world. The cu- -- the product made here in the United States sold in Montreal or Paris or anywhere around the world is cheaper than it\\'s made here, where it was -- where it\\'s been produced.\\nFor years, many of us have been trying to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices, which would reduce, by the way, the federal deficit at the same time. Because when Medicare doesn\\'t have to pay the high price, guess what? It cuts your taxes. It cuts the amount of money that the federal government has to pay.\\nFor years, Big Pharma won. Big Pharma blocked us. But not this time. (Applause.)\\nI know I don\\'t look it, but I\\'ve been arou- -- I\\'ve been around for 400 years. (Laughter.) And I\\'ve been fighting Pharma on this since the 1970s. No, not a joke.\\nThis time, we finally beat Big Pharma. Medicare finally has the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, like the Department of Veterans Affairs has -- had the power.\\nThat\\'s not all. We\\'ve heard -- you\\'ve heard -- this was already spoken to: insulin. Companies pay -- it costs -- and, by the way, the guy who invented the insulin, he never patented it because he wanted it available for everybody. It never was patented.\\nAnd guess what? It costs 10 bucks to make. And if you use everything including packaging, it could be as high as 12 and a half dollars. Now those companies are charging 30 times that amount.\\nNow seniors on Medicare -- and, by the way, it should be beyond seniors and Medicare, but I\\'ll come back to that at another time -- were paying as much as $400 a month for insulin. And they\\'re now just paying 35 bucks a month.\\nWe\\'re also capping total out-of-pocket expense for drugs for seniors on Medicare to $2,200 a year -- $2,000 a year for even the expensive cancer drugs that could cost as much as $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year. Combine all the costs of their drugs, by 2025, they\\'ll never have to pay more than a total of $2,000 after 2025. (Applause.)\\nOne -- one in three -- one in three seniors on Medicare is going to save an average of $400 a year. Seniors with the highest drug costs are going to save an average of $2,500 a year. And the Pharma companies are still going to do very, very well.\\nThe laws require that drug companies will raise prices faster than inflation. If they do that, they\\'re going to have to pay the difference back to Medicare. That\\'ll create an incentive to keep prices from skyrocketing. And negotiating drug prices alongside other parts of the law will save the federal government $160 billon -- reducing the cost of government by $160 billion.\\nIt will lower the federal deficit because it means -- what happens here is Medicare is going to be paying less for the prescription drugs they deliver to the American people. So, it not only lowers cost for the -- for the person receiving the drug, it lowers the cost for taxpayers -- lowers the cost for taxpayers.\\nAnd it gets to a third win for the American people with this law: We\\'ve made all the progress without raising taxes on the middle class.\\nI made a commitment -- and some thought it was too -- too much of a commitment; it\\'s too high -- that no one making less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny more in federal taxes. It\\'s a commitment I\\'ve kept so far. And as long as I\\'m president, I will keep it.\\nUnlike the last president, in my first two years in office, we actually cut the federal debt -- deficit by $1.7 trillion. You hear me? The first two years -- we cut the debt [deficit] by $1.7 trillion. (Applause.)\\nAnd through this law, we\\'re going to continue cutting the deficit and cutting subsidies to Big Pharma and ensuring the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share of federal taxes.\\nDoes anyone here think that the tax system is fair? In 2020 -- you remember, I was a pain in the neck about this; I know -- there were 55 of the largest corporations in America who paid zero in federal taxes -- 55 of the 500 -- of the Fortune 500. And they made $40 billion in profit. Didn\\'t pay a penny.\\nNot anymore. The law requires a minimum tax of 15 percent on our biggest corporations and a 1 percent excise tax on stock buybacks when they pay profits to shareholders.\\nThe law also saves money by cracking down on super-wealthy tax cheats, making sure billionaires -- who pay -- by the way, there\\'s about a thousand now. We used to have 750 before the pandemic. By the way, if you\\'re going to be a billionaire -- not a problem. I\\'m -- I\\'m a capitalist. I also was listed for 36 years the poorest man in the Senate, but that\\'s a different issue. (Laughter.) But billionaires and the biggest corporations should at least pay the taxes they owe.\\nDo you know what the average tax on a billionaire in America is today -- federal tax? 8.2 percent.\\nYou know, a janitor makes -- pays a higher tax than that.\\nFolks, this law is transformative. And it feel -- you know, it fell entirely to Democrats to deliver it. I hope we\\'ve seen -- with all the people out there claiming the credit for it -- they\\'ve decided that we\\'re going to -- they\\'re going to join the fight. They\\'re going to join the fight.\\nI took a -- I guess I shouldn\\'t get into that. (Laughter.) But one congressperson, who has been particularly strident about me, laid out all that we did. We just took it and used it as an ad. (Laughter and applause.) You think I\\'m kidding.\\nLook, the idea that not one single Republican voted for it -- you know, I -- and I know my colleagues know this, and I -- I\\'ve had seven of my Repub- -- former Republican colleagues in the Senate come to me and say they agreed with us. And -- but I promised I\\'d never say their names, and I never will tell anybody. But the reason they did that was -- they said, \"Joe, if I vote for X, Y, or Z, it\\'s going to -- they\\'re going to primary, and it will cost me my election.\"\\nNot a lot of political courage, but an explanation as to why there\\'s a lot of people who believe what we\\'re doing is right, but just -- they\\'re a little worried in this environment.\\nIn fact, Republicans have repeatedly tried to repeal key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, including the Speaker of the House now -- taking credit for the billions of dollars in private investments and thousands of jobs coming into their states.\\nThat\\'s okay. I ran for president, and I said I would represent all Americans. And like I said at the State of the Union, \"I\\'ll see you at the groundbreaking.\" (Laughter.) You think I\\'m kidding. (Laughter.) You know I\\'m not.\\nLet me close with this. I\\'m not here to declare victory on the economy. Our economy is stronger and better than any industrial nation in the world right now. We -- but we have more work to do. We have a plan that\\'s running -- turning things around. The Inflation Reduction Act is a part of that plan.\\nBidenomics is just another way of saying \"restoring the American Dream.\"\\nI believe every American willing to work hard -- and I mean this from the bottom my heart. My dad used to say, \"Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.\" I give you my word. \"A lot more than a paycheck. It\\'s about your dignity. It\\'s about respect. It\\'s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, \\'Honey, it\\'s going to be okay,\\' and mean it.\"\\nAny re- -- any person willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live, raise their kids on a good paycheck, and keep their roots where they grew up.\\nHow many of you from Midwestern states and border states have found yourself in a position where -- they provide a good education, and you got a -- the son or daughter comes to you, \"Mom, Dad, I\\'ve got to move.\" When you were governor of Iowa, how many times did you hear that? You have one of the best education systems in the country. \"But I\\'ve got to move, Mom. There\\'s no job for me.\"\\nBidenomics is anchors -- anchored in what\\'s always worked best for the country: investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in ourselves, when we strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth. It benefits everybody.\\nLook, folks, I\\'m proud of the historic law my administration has passed, but it\\'s not about me, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. It\\'s about you -- all of you in this room, particularly, but the American people. Folks like the ones standing behind me here today.\\nThe most important thing I want to say today is: Thank you, America. Thank you, Americans.\\nWe\\'ve faced some tough times in recent years. But you, the American people, didn\\'t give up. You\\'re the ones getting up every single day going to work. You\\'re the ones taking the risks, opening the doors, hiring workers, fulfilling dreams.\\nAnd all we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle is what they claim is what\\'s wrong with America.\\nWell, let me tell you -- let -- let me tell you: They\\'re telling us America is failing -- failing? They\\'re dead wrong. They\\'re dead wrong. America isn\\'t failing; America is winning.\\nAnd I\\'ve said it a thousand times -- (applause) -- I\\'ve said it a thousand times -- a thousand times: There is no quit in America.\\nName me a single objective we\\'ve ever set out to accomplish that we failed on. Name me one in all of our history. Not one.\\nIt\\'s never been a good bet to bet against America, and it\\'s still not a good bet today. This is still a country that believes in honesty, decency, and integrity. We\\'re still a country that believes in hard work.\\nWe\\'re still a country that believes that each and every one of us is created equal. We\\'ve never fully lived up to it, but we never walked away from it.\\nAnd I guarantee you we\\'re still the beacon for the world. You ought to come with me to all these international meetings. Listen to the rest of the world -- what they say to the President of the United States.\\nEveryday, ordinary people every day get up and do extraordinary things. That\\'s who we are.\\nAmerica\\'s best days aren\\'t behind us; they\\'re ahead of us. This isn\\'t about the past. It\\'s about the future we\\'re going to build. And I\\'ve never been more optimistic about America\\'s future.\\nJust remember who in God\\'s name we are. We\\'re the United States of America. And there\\'s nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. (Applause.)\\nGod bless you all. And may God protect our troops.\\nThank you, thank you, thank you.
